        <p>You’re not a cat or a dog person</p>
        <p>Because you’re into bitches (and delusion)</p>
        <p>Baby potato is your snack, and teal is your vibe</p>
        <p>You’re sweet as sugar and everything nice</p>

        <p>The time when we used to stay up all night on threads</p>
        <p>And remember, it was you who slid into my dms</p>
        <p>How we even turned the threads to our personal dms</p>
        <p>And talking through thousands of comments</p>

        <p>The first time I heard your voice, I was mesmerised</p>
        <p>Still can't believe you sang for me—it’s saved, and it’s prized.</p>
        <p>I love our VCs, you’re so cute when you get fake mad</p>
        <p>All the drama and fun we have</p>

        <p>Our movie nights – “Gone Girl” will forever haunt me,</p>
        <p>And watching it with you was pure insanity.</p>
        <p>Our game nights – no one’s cheating, you just suck at Ludo,</p>
        <p>And I’m terrible at Discord games, as you already know.</p>
        <p>
          I’m a huge fan of your music taste (made a Spotify playlist after
          you),
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a huge fan of your “Art and Craft” (have all your masterpieces
          saved, it’s true).
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a huge fan of your wit and humor (I upvote all your comments on
          Reddit),
        </p>
        <p>You make me laugh like no other, I’ll never forget it.</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday to you, the best there is,</p>
        <p>Wishing you happiness, love, and bliss.</p>
        <p>May your day be bright and your year even more,</p>
        <p>Filled with joy, success, and so much more!</p>
